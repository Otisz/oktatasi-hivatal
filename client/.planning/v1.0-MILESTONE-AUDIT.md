# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** Hungarian Admission Score Calculator — Vue Client v1.0
**Audited:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** TECH_DEBT (all requirements met, no critical blockers, minor cleanup needed)

---

## Executive Summary

All 22 v1 requirements are satisfied across all three verification sources. All 4 phases passed verification. All 6 end-to-end flows trace through without breaks. Cross-phase wiring is complete — every export from each phase is consumed by the expected downstream phase.

Three minor tech debt items were identified (dead import, stale documentation x2). None are functional blockers.

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Status | Score | Critical Gaps | Human Verification Items |
|-------|--------|-------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 01 — Foundation | passed | 7/7 | 0 | 2 (Tailwind visual, env var runtime) |
| 02 — Routing & Data Layer | passed | 12/12 | 0 | 4 (route redirect, detail route, catch-all, progress bar) |
| 03 — Applicant List View | human_needed | 6/6 | 0 | 5 (skeleton, hover, cache nav, responsive, empty state) |
| 04 — Score Detail View | human_needed | 6/6 | 0 | 4 (programme header, cold skeleton, 422 card, cache nav) |

All phases passed automated verification. 15 items across phases flagged for human browser confirmation — these are visual/timing behaviors that cannot be asserted via static analysis.

## Integration Check Results

### Cross-Phase Wiring: All Connected

### E2E Flows: 6/6 Complete

1. **App bootstrap** — main.ts → App.vue → router → VueQueryPlugin — COMPLETE
2. **Default redirect** — / → /applicants → ApplicantsView — COMPLETE
3. **List → detail navigation** — useApplicants → RouterLink → applicant-detail route → ApplicantDetailView — COMPLETE
4. **Score display with 422 discrimination** — useApplicantScore → domain/generic error branches → amber card or retry — COMPLETE
5. **Progress bar** — useProgress → router guards → App.vue v-if — COMPLETE
6. **Back navigation** — RouterLink "Vissza" → /applicants → cached list (no skeleton flash) — COMPLETE

## Tech Debt

### Phase 03: Applicant List View

- **Dead import:** `useRouter` from `vue-router` is imported and called in `ApplicantsView.vue` but the `router` const is never used — navigation uses declarative `<RouterLink>` instead of programmatic `router.push()`. Should be removed to keep the file clean.

### Phase 02: Routing & Data Layer

- **Stale SUMMARY documentation:** `02-02-SUMMARY.md` states the score endpoint returns `ScoreResult` directly without an `ApiResponse<T>` envelope. This was corrected in commit `77f55fc` (the real API wraps score in `{ data: { ... } }`), but the SUMMARY was not updated to reflect the fix.

### ROADMAP.md

- **Stale checkbox/status:** Phase 2 is marked `[ ]` (unchecked) and shows "In Progress" in the progress table, despite having a passing VERIFICATION.md and all plans complete.

### Total: 3 items across 3 locations

---

## Anti-Patterns

None found across any phase. Zero TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER comments, no stub returns, no console.log statements, no dead code (except the useRouter import noted above).
